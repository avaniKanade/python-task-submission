# python-task-submission
This repository contains two Python scripts that fulfill the requirements for basic input/output and arithmetic operations using user interaction.
Assignment 1
 Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### Description:
This script takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

 Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Description:
This script asks the user to input their first and last names. It then combines them to create a full name and prints a friendly greeting.

 Assignemnt 2
 task 1: Check if number is even/odd.
 This Python program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement. It uses the modulo operator to determine 
 
 task 2: Sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
This Python task involves using a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50, calculating the cumulative sum of all integers in that range. After the loop completes, the program displays the final sum using a formatted print statement. It demonstrates basic iteration and arithmetic logic in Python.
 divisibility by 2. If divisible, it's even; otherwise, it's odd. The result is displayed in a formatted output using print()

Assignment 3
Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This task defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop or recursion. It teaches function creation, return values, and control flow, helping reinforce logic building

Task 2: Use Math Module for Calculations
his task involves creating a Python program that uses the built-in math module to perform three mathematical operations on a user-input number: square root, natural logarithm, and sine.
